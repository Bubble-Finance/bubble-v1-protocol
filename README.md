# Project Introduction
 Welcome to Monadex, the ultimate first community-driven and ecosystem-focused DEX built on Monad. 
 This repository houses the governance, raffle, and core smart contracts for Monadex V1, providing a robust foundation for decentralized exchange operations. Monadex is designed to empower the community by offering a platform that is not only user-friendly but also highly secure and efficient.

For those seeking non-technical, in-depth documentation, we have prepared a comprehensive guide available on [GitBook](https://monadex.gitbook.io/monadex). This resource is tailored to provide a thorough understanding of Monadex, its features, and how to get started, making it an invaluable asset for both newcomers and experienced users alike.

Join us in shaping the future of decentralized finance by contributing to Monadex. Whether you're a developer looking to build on our platform, a trader seeking a new exchange, or simply curious about the project, we welcome you to explore and engage with our community.
